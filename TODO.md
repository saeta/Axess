# High Priorities #

 - Add timing (i.e. daily run tests)
 - Default to axess.CourseraSite for site type.
 - Test more!
 - Checkers
 - Make everything more modular and configurable (and injectable).
   (Consider using Guice)

# Things to do! #

 - Move to multi-project set up with interface for `Site` defined in a separate file (also `Checker`)
 - Make `Site` based on configuration, defined in special config
 - The above should be an Akka extension
 - Make navigation template helper to make it easier to have the top bar done correctly
 - Write up instructions to build and run.
 - Make landing page useful with rant about instructions, etc.

## Checkers ##

 - Check all links get to valid pages. (Including outside the site!)
 - Check that all inputs that are not hidden or submit have a label
