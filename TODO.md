 - Scan a site!
 - Move to multi-project set up with interface for `Site` defined in a separate file (also `Checker`)
 - Make `Site` based on configuration, defined in special config
 - The above should be an Akka extension
 - Make navigation template helper to make it easier to have the top bar done correctly
 - Write up instructions to build and run.
