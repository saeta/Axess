        <small>3/19/12</small></h2>
        <p>When I went to write the <code>models.CourseWareSite</code> login
        module, Selenium's HtmlUnit driver didn't run Javascript. Because
        the normal code path for Javascript-enabled browsers didn't work, I
        turned off Javascript in order to debug. It turns out, the
        non-javascript login had been neglected, and instead routed people
        to <code>federation.org</code>, a domain name unaffiliated, and
        outside of anyone's control.</p>
        
        <p>When I emailed the CourseWare people, they were very fast on the
        draw, and fixed the issue within a couple hours. Good work!</p>
        
        <h2>Axess passes Axess <small>3/19/12</small></h2>
        <p>I demo'd this tool to my girlfriend, and bragged about how it
        finds all these easy-to-fix accessibility errors. She turned around
        and challenged me to run it on itself. So I did. And found a few
        bugs of my own! As of this writing, Axess comes back clean.</p>
